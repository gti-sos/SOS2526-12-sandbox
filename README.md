## 📝 Project Description:
Our project analyzes the correlation between population growth and social structure. We aim to understand global demographic trends by utilizing international data sources focused on:

*  **Birth & Death Rates:** Analyzing natural growth factors.
*  **Fertility by Age:** Understanding reproductive trends across different age groups.
*  **Population Structure:** Breaking down demographics by sex and age to visualize population pyramids.

##  Sources & Data
The project relies on Open Data from international census records (Kaggle/Census Bureau), specifically tracking vital statistics and population breakdowns.
